## Last Session: Implement periodic reconciliation with full test suite (3su)

### Completed
- Added `ReconciliationConfig` to `config.rs` with `every: u32` field (default 3)
  - Configurable via `[reconciliation]` section in blacksmith.toml
  - Setting `every = 0` disables reconciliation
- Added `ReconciliationTracker` to `integrator.rs` that:
  - Counts successful integrations since last reconciliation
  - Tracks recently-integrated bead IDs for flagging
  - Returns `true` from `record_success()` when threshold reached
  - Resets counter and bead list after reconciliation runs
- Added `ReconciliationResult` struct with pass/fail status, test output, and flagged beads
- Added `run_reconciliation()` method to `IntegrationQueue` that:
  - Runs the full test suite on main (cargo test for Rust, npm test for Node.js)
  - Returns flagged bead IDs when tests fail, empty list when they pass
  - Always resets the tracker after running
- Added `run_test_suite()` helper method (private) for running project tests
- Updated test configs in coordinator.rs and runner.rs with new `reconciliation` field
- Added 13 new tests (689 total passing):
  - Config: reconciliation default, load from TOML, default when unspecified, zero disables
  - Tracker: new, record below threshold, triggers at threshold, reset, zero never triggers, every-one always triggers
  - Integration: no build system passes, valid Rust project passes, failing Rust project flags beads

### Key Files Modified
- `src/config.rs` — ReconciliationConfig struct, added to HarnessConfig
- `src/integrator.rs` — ReconciliationTracker, ReconciliationResult, run_reconciliation, run_test_suite
- `src/coordinator.rs` — test config update
- `src/runner.rs` — test config update

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **dgh**: Implement session-to-bead attribution (P2)
- **7ed**: Implement blacksmith integration log and retry commands (P2)
- **dfe**: Implement git revert rollback with entanglement tracking (P2)
