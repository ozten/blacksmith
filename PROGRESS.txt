## Last Session: Scaffold Rust project (simple-agent-harness-ewc)

### Completed
- Created Cargo.toml with all dependencies (clap, serde, toml, tokio, nix, chrono, serde_json, tracing, tracing-subscriber)
- Created src/main.rs with clap CLI that compiles, prints help, and has --dry-run/--status stubs
- Created stub modules: config.rs, runner.rs, session.rs, watchdog.rs, retry.rs, metrics.rs, signals.rs, hooks.rs
- config.rs has full deserialization structs with defaults matching harness.toml spec
- Created default harness.toml with all config sections from the PRD
- cargo build, cargo test, cargo clippy, cargo fmt all pass cleanly

### Current State
- Project skeleton is complete and compiles
- CLI accepts all flags from the PRD spec (config, prompt, output-dir, timeout, retries, dry-run, verbose, quiet, status, max_iterations positional arg)
- All stub modules have empty structs ready for implementation
- No actual logic implemented yet — just the skeleton

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement configuration loading (config.rs): parse harness.toml, merge CLI overrides
- Implement CLI argument parsing integration with config (main.rs)
- These are covered by the next bead: simple-agent-harness-utz (P1, was blocked by this scaffold task)
