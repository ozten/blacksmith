## Session: Resolve shared repo-level .blacksmith path in git worktrees (simple-agent-harness-1d04)

### Completed
- Verified existing implementation for default data-dir resolution in git worktrees already satisfies the bead requirements.
- Confirmed targeted tests pass:
  - `cargo test --release test_resolve_storage_data_dir_shared_between_main_and_worktree`
  - `cargo test --release test_resolve_storage_data_dir_respects_non_default_config_path`
- Confirmed full quality gates pass:
  - `cargo test --release`
  - `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`
  - `cargo fmt --check`

### Current State
- Working tree has no source diff in this session.
- Bead is ready to close based on verified existing behavior.

### Suggested Next Task
- Continue with next highest-priority ready bead after this closure.
