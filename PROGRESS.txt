## Session: Make command_in_path pub(crate) (simple-agent-harness-8l0p)

### Completed
- Changed `fn command_in_path` to `pub(crate) fn command_in_path` in src/config.rs
- This makes the function available to other modules (e.g., the upcoming preflight module)

### Files Changed
- src/config.rs (visibility change on command_in_path)
- src/finish.rs (cargo fmt auto-fix for pre-existing formatting issue)

### Current State
- All 1117 tests pass
- Zero clippy warnings, formatting clean

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Pick up unblocked tasks: simple-agent-harness-6in9 (preflight check module), simple-agent-harness-dpmv (agent detection/init)
