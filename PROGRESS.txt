## Last Session: Verify raw adapter implementation (e2l)

### Completed
- Verified that the raw adapter (`src/adapters/raw.rs`) is already fully implemented:
  - `RawAdapter` struct with `new()` and `Default` implementations
  - `AgentAdapter` trait: `name()` returns "raw", `extract_builtin_metrics()` returns empty vec,
    `supported_metrics()` returns empty slice, `lines_for_source()` returns raw file lines
    for all ExtractionSource variants (pass-through behavior)
  - Wired into `create_adapter()` as fallback for all unknown adapter names
  - 6 unit tests covering name, empty metrics, empty supported_metrics, pass-through lines,
    missing file error, and empty file handling
  - Config integration tests for adapter override to "raw"
- All 38 adapter tests pass
- Bead was already implemented in a prior session; this session confirmed completeness

### Current State
- Raw adapter fully functional as fallback for unrecognized agents
- Universal metrics (session.output_bytes, exit_code, duration_secs) come from the harness,
  not the adapter, per spec lines 333-340

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **503**: Implement retention policy enforcement (P2)
- **tzx**: Implement prompt_via config with arg/stdin/file delivery modes (P2)
- **hxq**: Add agent.coding and agent.integration config sections (P2)
