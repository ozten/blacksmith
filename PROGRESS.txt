## Session: Implement GET /api/beads endpoint (simple-agent-harness-zcli)

### Completed
- Added GET /api/beads endpoint to serve API
- Reads .beads/issues.jsonl from project root directory
- Returns JSON with open_count, in_progress_count, and items array
- Each item includes: id, title, status, type, priority, assignee, description
- Supports ?status= query parameter to filter beads by status
- Added beads_dir to AppState for accessing .beads directory
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Files Changed
- src/serve.rs: Added BeadsQuery, BeadItem, BeadsResponse structs; api_beads handler; beads_dir to AppState; /api/beads route

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- GET /api/beads returns JSON with bead listing and counts
- Counts reflect all beads regardless of filter; items respect ?status= filter

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Other serve API endpoints (simple-agent-harness-3hps, k57l, oadl, sqpv, ts82)
