## Last Session: Implement integration retry loop with circuit breaker state tracking (t4x)

### Completed
- Added `CircuitBreaker` struct to `src/integrator.rs` that tracks per-bead integration attempt counts
- Added `CircuitState` enum with three states: `Closed` (no attempts), `Retrying { attempt }` (retries remain), `Tripped { attempts }` (max exceeded)
- `MAX_INTEGRATION_ATTEMPTS` const set to 3 per spec
- CircuitBreaker API:
  - `new()` / `default()` — create empty tracker
  - `state(bead_id)` — get current circuit state for a bead
  - `record_attempt(bead_id)` — increment attempt count, returns new state
  - `reset(bead_id)` — clear attempts after successful integration
  - `attempt_count(bead_id)` — get raw attempt count
- CircuitState API:
  - `can_retry()` — true for Closed and Retrying states
  - `is_tripped()` — true only for Tripped state
  - `attempt_count()` — returns the attempt number
  - `Display` impl for human-readable status
- Added 10 tests covering all states, transitions, reset, independent beads, overflow, display
- All 621 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

### Key Files Modified
- `src/integrator.rs` — added CircuitBreaker, CircuitState, MAX_INTEGRATION_ATTEMPTS, and 10 tests

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **m5l**: Implement integration agent spawning for compiler fixes (P1, now unblocked by t4x)
- **yg5**: Implement integration circuit breaker and failure handling (P1, now unblocked by t4x)
- **hxq**: Add agent.coding and agent.integration config sections (P2, blocks m5l)
