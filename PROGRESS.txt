## Last Session: Rename package and binary from simple-agent-harness to blacksmith (simple-agent-harness-ynf)

### Completed
- Renamed Cargo.toml package name from `simple-agent-harness` to `blacksmith`
- Updated CLI struct: command name to `blacksmith`, default config to `blacksmith.toml`
- Updated dry-run output header from `simple-agent-harness` to `blacksmith`
- Updated startup log message from `simple-agent-harness starting` to `blacksmith starting`
- Updated `--status` output to say "No running blacksmith detected"
- Updated status file from `harness.status` to `blacksmith.status` in main.rs and runner.rs
- Updated status.rs doc comments and temp file pattern from `.harness.status.tmp` to `.blacksmith.status.tmp`
- Updated all status.rs test file names to `blacksmith.status`
- Added backwards-compatible config loading: tries `blacksmith.toml` first, falls back to `harness.toml`
- Created `blacksmith.toml` from `harness.toml` with updated header comment
- Kept `harness.toml` for backwards compatibility (users can migrate at their own pace)
- Kept `HARNESS_*` environment variables unchanged (public API for hooks)
- All 158 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Binary is now `blacksmith` (cargo builds as `blacksmith`)
- Config defaults to `blacksmith.toml` with fallback to `harness.toml`
- Status file is now `blacksmith.status`
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented features

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement --dry-run mode (5x6) — P3
- Implement --quiet mode for minimal output (r43) — P3
- Implement config validation with helpful error messages (edb) — P3
