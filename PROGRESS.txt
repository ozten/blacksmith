## Session: Debounce dependency-filter INFO logs (simple-agent-harness-1on9)

### Completed
- Added coordinator-loop state tracking for previous dependency-filter counts: `(blocked_count, ready_count)`.
- Moved `filtered out N beads with unresolved dependencies` emission to the loop:
  - INFO when counts change (including first occurrence)
  - DEBUG when counts are unchanged
- Extended `BeadQuery` with `blocked_count` so logging decisions are made at the scheduling call site.
- Added/updated unit tests in `src/coordinator.rs` for `blocked_count` behavior and INFO/debounce decision helper.
- Verification run: `cargo test`, `cargo test --release`, `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check`.

### Current State
- Repeated identical dependency-filter polls no longer spam INFO logs.
- Transitions in blocked/ready counts surface at INFO, with repeated steady-state messages downgraded to DEBUG.
- Working tree changes are limited to `src/coordinator.rs`.

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Pick the next ready P1 bead from `bd ready`.
