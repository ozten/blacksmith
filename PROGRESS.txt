## Last Session: Implement improve show/update/promote/dismiss/search commands (simple-agent-harness-v25)

### Completed
- Added `db::get_improvement(conn, ref_id)` — fetch single improvement by ref
- Added `db::get_improvement_meta(conn, ref_id)` — fetch meta JSON field by ref
- Added `db::update_improvement(conn, ref_id, status, body, context, meta)` — dynamic field updates with auto-resolved timestamp on promote/dismiss
- Added `db::search_improvements(conn, query)` — case-insensitive LIKE search across title, body, context
- Added 5 new CLI handlers in `improve.rs`:
  - `handle_show(db_path, ref_id)` — display all fields for a single improvement
  - `handle_update(db_path, ref_id, status, body, context)` — modify fields by ref
  - `handle_promote(db_path, ref_id)` — shorthand for status=promoted with resolved timestamp
  - `handle_dismiss(db_path, ref_id, reason)` — shorthand for status=dismissed with reason in meta JSON
  - `handle_search(db_path, query)` — full-text search with tabular output
- Wired 5 new `ImproveAction` variants (Show, Update, Promote, Dismiss, Search) in main.rs
- 33 new tests across db.rs and improve.rs (270 total tests pass)
- Clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- CLI now supports all 7 improve subcommands: add, list, show, update, promote, dismiss, search
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for functions consumed by future features (events, observations, etc.)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Add quantitative metrics summary to brief command output (pcb) — P2, ready
- Implement configurable extraction rules from TOML config (i9s) — P2, ready
- Implement configurable target thresholds and metrics targets command (obm) — P2, ready
