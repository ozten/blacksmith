## Last Session: Add public API surface extractor for modules (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-ehy: public API surface extractor
- Created src/public_api.rs with:
  - `Symbol` struct: kind, name, signature, file for each public symbol
  - `ModuleApi` struct: module_name + public_symbols vector
  - `extract_public_apis()` — extracts public API for all detected modules
  - `extract_module_api()` — extracts public API for a single module
  - `format_boundary_signatures()` — formats symbols into boundary_signatures strings
  - `extract_from_files()` — convenience for extracting without full module detection
  - `extract_symbols_from_source()` — line-by-line parser for pub declarations
- Handles: pub fn, pub async fn, pub struct, pub enum, pub trait, pub const, pub static, pub type
- Correctly skips: pub(crate), pub(super), pub(in ...) restricted visibility
- Skips comments (line and block), attributes
- Signature cleaning: removes trailing `{`, normalizes whitespace
- 27 tests covering all symbol kinds, visibility filtering, multi-module extraction, sorting, edge cases

### Current State
- Compilation clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- Full test suite: 1014 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
- public_api module ready for downstream beads (boundary violations, structural metrics)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-q5v (P2): Add fan-in hotspot scoring for files
- simple-agent-harness-33k (P2): Add circular dependency detection for modules
- simple-agent-harness-n1d (P2): Add metadata regeneration strategy with lazy invalidation
- simple-agent-harness-aol (P2): Add boundary violation detector (now unblocked by this bead)
- simple-agent-harness-9xc (P2): Add god file detection via cohesion analysis (now unblocked)
