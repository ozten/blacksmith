## Last Session: Implement session spawning and output capture (simple-agent-harness-d3v)

### Completed
- Implemented session.rs with full session lifecycle:
  - `SessionResult` struct: exit_code, output_bytes, duration, output_file, pid
  - `SessionError` enum: OutputFile, Spawn, Io variants with Display + Error impls
  - `output_file_path()`: builds {output_dir}/{output_prefix}-{global_iteration}.jsonl
  - `build_args()`: replaces {prompt} placeholders in agent args with actual prompt content
  - `run_session()`: spawns agent subprocess, captures stdout+stderr to file, returns SessionResult
    - Uses process_group(0) for clean process group management
    - Uses Stdio::from(File) to redirect both stdout and stderr to the output file
    - Reports exit code, output bytes (from file metadata), wall-clock duration, and PID
- 12 tests covering:
  - output_file_path construction (custom and default)
  - build_args with/without/multiple placeholders
  - run_session: echo command, stderr capture, nonzero exit, spawn failure, correct byte count, duration, bad output path
- All 22 tests pass (10 config + 12 session), clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Session spawning is fully functional and tested
- Unblocks: runner loop (p0y), watchdog (fvr), retry policy (jr7), prompt prepend_commands (mxg)
- Stub modules still have dead_code warnings (expected)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement main runner loop (simple-agent-harness-p0y) — now unblocked by session + config
- Implement signal handling (simple-agent-harness-7rx) — already unblocked
- Implement watchdog (simple-agent-harness-fvr) — now unblocked by session
