## Last Session: Implement pre/post-session hook execution (simple-agent-harness-8ff)

### Completed
- Replaced placeholder hooks.rs with full implementation:
  - `HookRunner` struct with `run_pre_session()` and `run_post_session()` methods
  - `HookEnv` struct for building environment variables available to hooks
  - `HookError` / `HookErrorKind` error types with Display + Error impls
  - Hooks executed via `sh -c` with environment variables injected
  - Pre-session hooks: HARNESS_ITERATION, HARNESS_GLOBAL_ITERATION, HARNESS_PROMPT_FILE
  - Post-session hooks: all pre vars plus HARNESS_OUTPUT_FILE, HARNESS_EXIT_CODE, HARNESS_OUTPUT_BYTES, HARNESS_SESSION_DURATION, HARNESS_COMMITTED
- Integrated hooks into runner.rs:
  - Pre-session hooks run before each session, after output dir setup
  - Pre-session hook failure skips the iteration and counts as consecutive error
  - Post-session hooks run after Proceed and Skip decisions (productive sessions)
  - Post-session hooks do NOT run during Retry (empty session retries)
  - Post-session hook failures are logged but don't stop the loop
  - Status transitions to PreHooks/PostHooks states during hook execution
- Added 12 hooks unit tests (env construction, success/failure, env var passing)
- Added 5 runner integration tests (pre hooks with env, pre hook failure, post hooks with env, post hook failure continues, empty retry skips post hooks)
- All 103 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Hook system is fully functional per spec
- `committed` field always false (commit detection not yet implemented)
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented features

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement prompt prepend_commands (mxg) — P2, unblocked
- Implement rate limit detection with exponential backoff (7d0) — P3, will populate rate_limited field
- Implement commit detection in session output (ee7) — P3, will populate committed field
