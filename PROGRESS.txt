## Last Session: Implement improve add and improve list CLI subcommands (simple-agent-harness-evl)

### Completed
- Added clap subcommand structure to `src/main.rs`: `blacksmith improve add` and `blacksmith improve list`
- `improve add` takes positional title, required `--category`, optional `--body`, `--context`, `--tags`
- Auto-assigns next ref (R1, R2, ...) on creation using existing `db::next_ref`
- `improve list` supports `--status` and `--category` filters, displays in table format
- Created `src/improve.rs` with `handle_add` and `handle_list` command handlers
- Added `db::insert_improvement` and `db::list_improvements` query functions to `src/db.rs`
- Added `db::Improvement` struct for query results
- 7 new tests (in improve.rs): add, add with all fields, multiple ref increment, list empty, filter by status, filter by category, combined filters
- All 178 tests pass, clippy clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings), fmt applied
- Smoke tested CLI: add, list, filtered list all work correctly

### Current State
- `improve add` and `improve list` are fully functional
- Database path defaults to `./blacksmith.db`, overridable with `--output-dir`
- The `--output-dir` flag is global (works with subcommands), other run-mode flags are not
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented features

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Create events and observations tables in database module (cl6) — P1, ready
- Implement improve show/update/promote/dismiss/search commands (v25) — P2, now unblocked
- Implement brief command with improvement context output (11h) — P1, now unblocked
