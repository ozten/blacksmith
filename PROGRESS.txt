## Completed: simple-agent-harness-aegv — Bead deliverable verification gate

### What was done
Added step 0c to `bd-finish.sh` that verifies bead deliverables before allowing `bd close`:

1. **Affected files check (new)**: Files marked `(new)` in `## Affected files` must exist on disk. Hard failure if missing.
2. **Affected files check (modified)**: Files marked `(modified)` must exist. Warning (not failure) if file exists but has no git diff changes.
3. **Verify command execution**: `Run:` commands from `## Verify` section are extracted and executed. Non-zero exit = hard failure.
4. **Graceful degradation**: If `bd show --json` fails or the bead has no Verify/Affected files sections, warns but doesn't block.

### Key implementation details
- Uses `bd show --allow-stale --json` to avoid sync issues in worktrees
- Uses `printf '%s'` instead of `echo` when piping JSON to avoid escape sequence interpretation
- Runs AFTER cargo check + cargo test (step 0c) but BEFORE staging/commit/close
- Verification failure exits with code 1 and prints actionable guidance

### Files changed
- `bd-finish.sh` (modified — added step 0c deliverable verification gate)

### Current state
- `bd-finish.sh` updated with verification gate
- All 1147 tests pass
- `cargo check` passes
- Shell syntax validated (`bash -n`)

### Suggested next tasks
- Consider adding `## Verify` sections to existing open beads that lack them
- The beads simple-agent-harness-374 and simple-agent-harness-2kb mentioned in the bug report can now be re-attempted — the verification gate will prevent false closures
