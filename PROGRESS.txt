## Session: Auto-close epics when all children are closed (simple-agent-harness-nvzo)

### Completed
- Extended post-integration bead-closing flow in `src/integrator.rs` to auto-close parent epics when all of their `parent-child` dependencies are no longer open.
- Added upward chaining: when an epic auto-closes, the logic re-checks whether that closure now makes its parent epic eligible.
- Kept failure behavior non-fatal: failures in `bd list`, `bd close`, or `bd sync` during auto-close emit warnings and integration continues.
- Added unit tests for parsing open-issue dependency data and determining parent-epic close eligibility.

### Verification Run
- `cargo test` (pass)
- `cargo test --release` (pass)
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` (pass)
- `cargo fmt --check` initially failed; applied `cargo fmt`
- `cargo check` (pass)

### Current State
- Integrated beads are closed in bd as before.
- After a successful close, parent epics are now evaluated and auto-closed when their children are complete, with recursive upward chaining.

### Suggested Next Task
- Add an integration-style test with a mocked/fake `bd` command path to validate end-to-end command sequencing (`close child -> sync -> close parent -> sync`) across multiple hierarchy levels.
