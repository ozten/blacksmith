## Session: Wire preflight into CLI, init, and harness startup (simple-agent-harness-7vta)

### Completed
- Added `Preflight` subcommand to `Commands` enum in main.rs
- Added `blacksmith preflight` handler: loads config, runs preflight, prints report, exits 1 on fatal
- Added advisory preflight at end of `Commands::Init` handler: runs checks after setup, prints warnings but doesn't abort
- Added preflight at harness startup: runs before singleton lock acquisition, aborts on fatal checks, logs warnings via tracing

### Files Changed
- src/main.rs (modified — added Preflight subcommand, handler, init advisory, harness startup checks)

### Current State
- All 1131 tests pass
- Clippy clean (only expected dead_code warning for preflight::fatals())
- Fmt clean

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Next ready beads from the queue
