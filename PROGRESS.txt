## Last Session: Closed simple-agent-harness-8iq (Exclude cycled beads from critical path estimation)

### What Was Done
- Refactored `compute_critical_path()` in `src/estimation.rs` to use `cycle_detect::detect_cycles()` from the `cycle_detect` module instead of inline Kahn's-based cycle detection
- The function now: calls `detect_cycles()` to get SCCs, collects all cycled bead IDs, filters them out of the bead list, then computes the critical path on the remaining clean DAG
- This consolidates cycle detection logic in one place (`cycle_detect.rs`) rather than having it duplicated in `estimation.rs`
- All existing tests pass (23 estimation tests, 846 total excluding coordinator slow test)
- The `format_estimate()` and `status.rs` already had proper cycle warning formatting from prior sessions

### Current State
- `estimation.rs` now imports and uses `crate::cycle_detect` for cycle detection
- All 846 tests pass, clippy and fmt clean
- The coordinator slow test (`coordinator_exits_with_no_work`) is pre-existing and unrelated

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-cqf: Surface cycle warnings in CLI status output (now unblocked)
