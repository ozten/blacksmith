## Session: Restore core poll endpoints (simple-agent-harness-946)

### Completed
- Added GET /api/status endpoint: reads StatusData from status file, returns JSON (or {"state":"idle"} if no file)
- Added GET /api/project endpoint: returns project name, workers_max, max_iterations
- Added GET /api/metrics/summary endpoint: aggregates cost_today, cost_this_week from observations, workers from status file, beads_closed_today from bead_metrics, session_outcomes from observations
- Extended AppState with status_path, project_name, workers_max, max_iterations fields
- Added 4 route coverage tests (status no-file, status with-file, project, metrics/summary)
- Added tower dev-dependency for axum test utilities

### Files Changed
- src/serve.rs: Three new handler functions + routes + test module
- Cargo.toml: Added tower dev-dependency

### Current State
- All 1084+ tests pass (1 pre-existing flaky watchdog test: test_monitor_kills_stale_process)
- Zero clippy warnings, formatting clean
- Pre-existing fmt issue in blacksmith-ui/src/main.rs (not touched)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-947: Restore session list/detail endpoints
- simple-agent-harness-948: Restore transcript endpoints for UI viewer
