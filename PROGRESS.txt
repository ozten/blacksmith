## Last Session: Add adapter config field and auto-detection from command name (6hk)

### Completed
- Added `adapter: Option<String>` field to `AgentConfig` in src/config.rs
  - Defaults to None (auto-detect from command name)
  - Deserializes from TOML `[agent] adapter = "..."` config
- Created src/adapters/raw.rs with `RawAdapter` implementing AgentAdapter:
  - Returns no built-in metrics (configurable rules only)
  - All source types return raw file lines unchanged
  - 5 tests for the raw adapter
- Added adapter registry/factory functions to src/adapters/mod.rs:
  - `detect_adapter_name(command)` — matches command basename against known agents, falls back to "raw"
  - `resolve_adapter_name(explicit, command)` — uses explicit override if provided, else auto-detects
  - `create_adapter(name)` — factory returning boxed AgentAdapter trait object
  - Known adapters: claude, codex, opencode, aider; unknown falls back to raw
  - 18 tests covering detection, resolution, creation, and config integration
- Added 3 config tests for adapter field parsing
- Updated all AgentConfig struct literals in session.rs and runner.rs to include adapter: None
- All 442 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

### Current State
- The adapter config and detection pipeline is complete
- `create_adapter` currently returns ClaudeAdapter for "claude" and RawAdapter for everything else
- Future adapter implementations (codex, opencode, aider) will be added to the match in create_adapter
- Dead code warnings on adapters module are expected until wiring happens (bead 9jw)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **9jw**: Wire adapter into ingest pipeline replacing hardcoded parsing (now unblocked)
- **zl7**: Add coordinator SQLite tables for multi-agent state (independent P1)
- **mjx**: Implement affected set parsing and glob overlap detection (independent P1)
