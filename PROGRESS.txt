## Session: Route workers.max=1 through coordinator (simple-agent-harness-2dln)

### Completed
- Removed the runner branch in main.rs — all configurations now use coordinator::run()

- Kept `mod runner` declaration and runner.rs intact for future cleanup bead

### Files Changed
- src/main.rs (modified — removed if/else dispatch, always use coordinator::run())
- src/coordinator.rs (modified — updated module doc comment)

### Current State
- All 1135 tests pass (1 ignored)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-teuq: Delete runner.rs (now unblocked by this bead)
