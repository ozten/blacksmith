## Session: Filter epics with open children from scheduling pool (simple-agent-harness-qfi5)

### Completed
- Added `issue_type` and `parent_child_ids` to `ReadyBead` so scheduler/coordinator can reason about epic hierarchy.
- Updated `parse_ready_beads_json()` to parse `issue_type` and extract child IDs from `dependencies` entries where `type == "parent-child"`.
- Updated `parse_and_filter_beads()` to exclude epics that still have any open child in the open bead set.
- Kept behavior unchanged for leaf tasks and epics with no open children.
- Added tests covering:
  - parsing `issue_type` and parent-child dependency IDs
  - filtering epic with open child
  - keeping epic whose children are closed/not-open

### Verification
- `cargo test -- test_parse_ready_beads_json` passed.
- `cargo test --release` passed (1110 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored).
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` passed.
- `cargo fmt --check` passed.

### Current State
- Ready-pool parsing now captures issue type metadata.
- Scheduling pool excludes epics that still have open child tasks, avoiding wasted worker assignments.
- Existing dependency filtering and cycle filtering continue to run after epic filtering.

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Pick next highest-priority ready bead.
