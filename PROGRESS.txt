## Last Session: Implement watchdog output-growth monitor (simple-agent-harness-fvr)

### Completed
- Implemented watchdog.rs with full output-growth monitoring:
  - `WatchdogOutcome` enum: ProcessExited, Killed
  - `monitor()`: public API taking WatchdogConfig, output file path, child PID
  - `monitor_inner()`: internal function taking Duration params (enables fast tests)
  - Algorithm: checks file size every check_interval, resets stale timer on growth, kills process group after stale_limit
  - `kill_process_group()`: SIGTERM → 5s wait → SIGKILL if still alive
  - `file_size()`: safe file size helper returning 0 on error
- 7 tests covering:
  - file_size: existing file, nonexistent, empty
  - monitor_kills_stale_process: verifies kill on no-growth process (stale_timeout=0)
  - monitor_resets_on_growth: process writes for 3s then stops, watchdog waits then kills (~5s test)
  - monitor_cancelled_returns_process_exited: tokio::select! cancellation pattern
- All 28 tests pass (10 config + 12 session + 6 watchdog), clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Watchdog is fully functional and tested
- Unblocks: runner loop (p0y) which was blocked by both session (d3v, done) and watchdog (fvr, now done)
- Stub modules still have dead_code warnings (expected until runner integrates them)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement main runner loop (simple-agent-harness-p0y) — now unblocked
- Implement retry policy (simple-agent-harness-jr7) — already unblocked
- Implement signal handling (simple-agent-harness-7rx) — already unblocked
