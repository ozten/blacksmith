## Last Session: Add improvement recording to PROMPT.md (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-56j (P1): Add improvement recording to agent PROMPT.md workflow
- Added "Improvement Recording" section to PROMPT.md with clear guidelines on when/how to use `blacksmith improve add`
- Includes when to record, when NOT to record, CLI syntax, and a concrete example
- Limits agents to at most 2 improvements per session to avoid wasting turn budget

### Current State
- Codebase compiles cleanly (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- All 1123 tests pass
- PROMPT.md now instructs agents to record institutional lessons via the improve CLI

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-5hg (P1): Enable 3 parallel agents in blacksmith.toml
- simple-agent-harness-cgo (P2): Add refactor proposal generation from architecture analysis
- simple-agent-harness-83g (P3): Add migration map generation for refactor tasks
