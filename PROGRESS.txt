## Last Session: Add module boundary detection from file tree (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-75u: module boundary detection
- Created src/module_detect.rs with:
  - `Module` struct (name, root_path, files, has_entry_point, entry_point, submodules)
  - `detect_modules(src_root, rs_files)` — groups .rs files by parent directory into logical modules
  - `detect_modules_from_repo(repo_root)` — convenience wrapper that collects files and detects modules
  - `module_name_from_path()` — derives module name from directory path (e.g., "adapters::claude")
  - `find_entry_point()` — detects mod.rs/lib.rs/main.rs entry points
  - `detect_submodules()` — finds direct child submodule directories
- Added `mod module_detect;` to main.rs
- 11 unit tests all pass covering: empty project, single file, sibling modules, subdir with mod.rs, nested submodules, submodule detection, no entry point, lib.rs entry point, name derivation, sorted files, integration with import_graph

### Current State
- Compilation clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings)
- Full test suite: 970 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
- module_detect is ready for downstream beads (cycle detection, boundary violations, public API extraction)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-ikw (P1): Implement file resolution from intent concepts (now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-33k (P2): Add circular dependency detection for modules (now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-aol (P2): Add boundary violation detector for module imports (now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-ehy (P2): Add public API surface extractor for modules (now unblocked)
