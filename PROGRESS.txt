## Session: Periodic orphaned bead recovery during coordinator runtime (simple-agent-harness-n1i5)

### Completed
- Added periodic orphan recovery in `src/coordinator.rs` with a 60-second interval inside the coordinator loop.
- Updated orphan recovery to skip bead IDs currently assigned to non-idle workers, preventing interference with active work.
- Extended recovery logging with a `phase` field (`startup` vs `periodic`) to make mid-run recoveries visible in logs.
- Added unit test coverage for non-idle assignment filtering.

### Verification Run
- `cargo test test_non_idle_assigned_bead_ids_excludes_idle_workers` (pass)
- `cargo test test_recover_orphaned_beads_does_not_panic` (pass)
- `cargo test --release` (pass; 1128 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored)
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` (pass)
- `cargo fmt --check` (reported diffs; formatted with `cargo fmt`)

### Current State
- Coordinator now performs startup and periodic orphan recovery.
- In-progress beads that are not tied to any non-idle worker are re-opened during runtime without waiting for coordinator restart.

### Suggested Next Task
- Add an integration-style test with mocked `bd` command responses to validate periodic recovery behavior end-to-end (in-progress list + active assignment exclusion + reopen call sequencing).
