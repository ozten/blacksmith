## Last Session: Implement rate limit detection with exponential backoff (simple-agent-harness-7d0)

### Completed
- Created src/ratelimit.rs with rate limit detection and backoff logic:
  - `detect_rate_limit()` scans output file for rate limit patterns
  - `detect_rate_limit_in_text()` internal helper checks text against compiled regex patterns
  - Patterns: JSON `"error":"rate_limit"`, text `usage limit`, `hit your limit`, `resets.*UTC` (case-insensitive)
  - Uses `regex` crate with `LazyLock` for compiled pattern caching
  - `backoff_delay()` computes exponential backoff: `initial_delay * 2^count`, capped at max_delay
  - Overflow-safe with checked_shl + saturating_mul
- Integrated into runner.rs:
  - Added `ExitReason::RateLimited` variant
  - After session passes retry check (Proceed), scans output for rate limit patterns
  - Rate-limited sessions: don't increment productive counter, apply exponential backoff, update status tracker
  - After max_consecutive_rate_limits, exits loop with RateLimited reason
  - Successful sessions reset consecutive_rate_limits counter to 0
  - Status tracker updated with consecutive_rate_limits on each detection
  - Event log entries now correctly report rate_limited=true/false
- Added `mod ratelimit` to main.rs
- Added `regex = "1"` to Cargo.toml dependencies
- 21 new tests (18 unit + 3 integration):
  - Unit: JSON pattern, text patterns (case-insensitive), file detection, missing file, backoff math, overflow safety
  - Integration: rate-limited sessions not counted productive, resets on success, event log shows rate_limited=true
- All 137 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Rate limit detection fully functional per PRD spec
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented features (metrics, status, watchdog, session)
- Note: bead 0t2 (rate limit false positive fix) should refine detection to only inspect final result event

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement commit detection in session output (ee7) — P3
- Implement --dry-run mode (5x6) — P3
- Fix rate limit false positives by only inspecting system events (0t2) — P3
