## Last Session: Implement git worktree lifecycle management (1jv)

### Completed
- Created src/worktree.rs with full git worktree lifecycle management
- worktree_name(): builds "worker-{N}-{bead-id}" directory name
- worktree_path(): builds full path under worktrees directory
- branch_exists(): checks if a git branch exists in a repo
- create(): creates a detached-HEAD worktree from a base branch
  - Validates branch exists before creating
  - Returns AlreadyExists error if path already on disk
- remove(): removes a worktree with --force, no-ops if already gone
- list(): lists all worktrees (excluding main) using porcelain format
- prune(): runs git worktree prune to clean stale metadata
- cleanup_orphans(): removes worktrees not in active_paths set, then prunes
- WorktreeError enum: AlreadyExists, BranchNotFound, GitError, Io
- 14 new tests covering all functions and edge cases
- Registered module in main.rs
- All 498 tests pass, clippy clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings), fmt clean

### Current State
- worktree.rs is ready for use by the worker pool manager (f9m)
- Functions are pub for cross-module access
- No external dependencies added (uses std::process::Command for git)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **v6v**: Implement task_manifest.toml parsing (independent P1)
- **f9m**: Implement worker pool manager (now unblocked by both 1jv and scheduler)
- **x1a**: Implement session compression with zstd (independent P2)
