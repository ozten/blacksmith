## Last Session: Implement status file with atomic JSON writes (simple-agent-harness-3dl)

### Completed
- Created src/status.rs with:
  - `HarnessState` enum: Starting, PreHooks, SessionRunning, WatchdogKill, Retrying, PostHooks, RateLimitedBackoff, Idle, ShuttingDown (all states from PRD)
  - `StatusData` struct: all JSON fields from PRD (pid, state, iteration, max_iterations, global_iteration, output_file, output_bytes, session_start, last_update, last_completed_iteration, last_committed, consecutive_rate_limits)
  - `StatusFile`: atomic write (write-to-temp + rename) and remove operations
  - `StatusTracker`: mutable state tracker with setter methods, builds StatusData and writes via StatusFile
  - `StatusError` enum with Display/Error impls
  - 7 unit tests covering atomic write, overwrite, remove, all state serialization, tracker lifecycle, error paths, error display
- Integrated StatusTracker into runner.rs:
  - Starting state at loop begin
  - SessionRunning state before each session spawn (with output_file, iteration, session_start)
  - Idle state after productive iterations
  - Retrying state on empty session retry
  - ShuttingDown state on all exit paths (STOP file, signal, prompt error, consecutive errors)
  - Status file removed on clean exit
- Status file written to `{output_dir}/harness.status`
- All 68 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Status file is fully functional with atomic writes at every state transition
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented modules (hooks, metrics) and not-yet-used status variants (PreHooks, PostHooks, WatchdogKill, RateLimitedBackoff)
- Those variants will be used when hooks (8ff) and rate limiting (7d0) are implemented

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement structured console logging with tracing (yyb) — P2, unblocked
- Implement pre/post-session hook execution (8ff) — P2, will use PreHooks/PostHooks states
- Implement JSONL event log (t0t) — P2, unblocked
