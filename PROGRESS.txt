## Last Session: Expansion Event Tracking (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Created src/expansion_event.rs implementing expansion event tracking for affected-set mismatches
- ExpansionEvent struct: task_id, predicted_modules, actual_modules, expansion_reason, timestamp
- DB table `expansion_events` with indexes on task_id and timestamp
- API functions: create_table(), record(), get_by_task(), get_recent(), count_by_module(), count_recent_expansions()
- count_by_module() identifies modules with poor boundary containment (frequent in actual_modules)
- count_recent_expansions() counts events within a sliding window of recent tasks (for threshold triggers)
- Registered module in src/main.rs and table creation in src/db.rs
- 9 tests covering: record/retrieve, empty results, multiple events same task, get_recent ordering, count_by_module, count_recent_expansions, empty modules, cross-task events
- Bead simple-agent-harness-74e closed

### Current State
- All tests pass (except coordinator test which is a pre-existing known slow test)
- Clippy clean (only expected dead_code warnings for not-yet-integrated modules)
- fmt clean

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-4wc (P2): Implement historical signal correlator (now unblocked by this)
- simple-agent-harness-ldy (P2): Add integration loop iteration tracking
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
