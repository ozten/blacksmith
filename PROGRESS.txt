## Last Session: Implement signal handling and graceful shutdown (simple-agent-harness-7rx)

### Completed
- Implemented signals.rs with full signal handling:
  - `SignalHandler` struct with Arc-shared atomic state for thread-safe shutdown coordination
  - `install()`: spawns tokio tasks for SIGINT and SIGTERM listeners
  - `shutdown_requested()` / `force_kill_requested()`: query shutdown state
  - `set_child_pid()` / `clear_child_pid()`: track current child for force-kill
  - `wait_for_force_kill()`: async wait with Notify for immediate force-kill reaction
  - `request_shutdown()`: mark graceful shutdown (used by STOP file and signals)
  - `check_stop_file()`: check for STOP file, delete it, mark shutdown
  - SIGINT handler: first SIGINT sets graceful shutdown, second within 3s triggers force-kill + SIGKILL to process group
  - SIGTERM handler: same as single SIGINT (graceful shutdown)
  - `kill_process_group()`: sends SIGKILL via nix killpg
- 10 tests covering:
  - test_initial_state: fresh handler has no flags set
  - test_request_shutdown: request_shutdown sets the flag
  - test_child_pid_management: set/clear child PID
  - test_stop_file_not_present: no STOP file returns NotPresent
  - test_stop_file_detected_and_deleted: STOP file detected, deleted, shutdown flagged
  - test_stop_file_sets_shutdown_flag: STOP file triggers shutdown
  - test_force_kill_flag: force_kill flag works
  - test_handler_is_clone: Arc-shared state across clones
  - test_wait_for_force_kill_returns_immediately_when_set: immediate return if already set
  - test_wait_for_force_kill_wakes_on_notify: async notify wakes waiter
- All 48 tests pass (10 config + 12 session + 6 watchdog + 10 retry + 10 signals), clippy clean, fmt applied

### Current State
- Signal handling is fully functional and tested
- Unblocks: runner loop (p0y) which depends on signals (7rx), retry (jr7, done), session (d3v, done), and watchdog (fvr, done)
- All P0 runner dependencies should now be satisfied

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement main runner loop orchestration (simple-agent-harness-p0y) — P0, should now be unblocked
- Implement structured console logging (simple-agent-harness-yyb) — P2, unblocked
