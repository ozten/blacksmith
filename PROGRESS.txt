## Last Session: Singleton Lock Verification (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Verified that bead simple-agent-harness-ckq (P0 bug: singleton lock) was already fully implemented
- src/singleton.rs: Complete flock-based lock with PID diagnostics, stale detection, drop-based release
- src/data_dir.rs:49: lock() method provides .blacksmith/lock path
- src/main.rs:1248: Lock acquired before coordinator/runner execution
- All 5 singleton tests pass

### Current State
- No code changes needed — feature was already complete
- 24 beads from PRD decomposition, 4 ready to work (after this one closes)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- P1 ready beads: 5f1 (intent data model), 0lk (file resolution model)
- These unlock the most downstream work
