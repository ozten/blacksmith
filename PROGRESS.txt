## Session 159: Fixed clippy warnings from Rust 1.92

### Completed
- Fixed 12 clippy warnings across 7 files (cloned_ref_to_slice_refs, statement with no effect)
- Ran cargo clippy --fix + manual fix for worktree.rs + cargo fmt
- All 1072 tests pass, 0 warnings, formatting clean

### Codebase State
- All V3 milestones (8, 8b, 9) are fully implemented
- All 195 beads closed, ready queue empty
- Zero TODOs/unimplemented markers in source
- Clean clippy + fmt + tests

### Suggested Next Tasks
- File new beads from PRD if there's a V4 spec or new requirements
- Consider performance profiling or integration testing
- The singleton lock issue (MEMORY.md) may still need addressing
