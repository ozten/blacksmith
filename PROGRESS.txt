## Last Session: Verify and close singleton lock fix (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Verified bead simple-agent-harness-xyc (P0): singleton lock fix
- Confirmed all components are in place:
  - fs2 = "0.4" present in Cargo.toml
  - singleton.rs compiles cleanly with all 5 tests passing
  - DataDir::lock() method exists in data_dir.rs
  - Singleton lock wired into coordinator startup at main.rs:1258
- No code changes needed — the fix was already applied by a prior session but the bead was never closed
- Full test suite: 1100 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored

### Current State
- Singleton lock is functional: prevents concurrent blacksmith instances
- Codebase compiles cleanly (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-a9n (P2): Implement structural metrics aggregator for architecture analysis
- simple-agent-harness-83g (P3): Add migration map generation for refactor tasks
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
