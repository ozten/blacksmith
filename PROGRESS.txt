## Last Session: Intent Analysis Data Model (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Created src/intent.rs with IntentAnalysis struct, TargetArea struct, content hashing, and SQLite caching layer
- IntentAnalysis has task_id, content_hash (hash of title+description+acceptance criteria), and target_areas (Vec<TargetArea>)
- DB table intent_analyses with UNIQUE(task_id, content_hash) constraint, keyed by content_hash for cache lookups
- Functions: content_hash(), create_table(), get_by_content_hash(), get_by_task_id(), store()
- 8 unit tests covering deterministic hashing, store/retrieve, cache miss, upsert, empty areas
- Registered module in main.rs, integrated table creation into db::open_or_create()

### Current State
- All tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- Dead code warnings on intent.rs functions are expected — downstream beads will use them
- Bead simple-agent-harness-5f1 closed

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-0lk (P1): Add file resolution data model and cache (similar pattern to intent)
- simple-agent-harness-d42 (P1): Implement LLM-based intent analysis (now unblocked by 5f1)
