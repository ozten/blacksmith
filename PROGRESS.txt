## Last Session: Implement blacksmith workers status and kill commands (wdo)

### Completed
- Added `blacksmith workers status` CLI subcommand that queries the DB for active worker assignments (status = 'coding' or 'integrating') and displays a formatted table with: worker ID, assignment ID, bead ID, status, elapsed time, and worktree path
- Added `blacksmith workers kill <worker-id>` CLI subcommand that:
  - Finds active assignments for the given worker ID
  - Searches for agent processes via `lsof` and `pgrep` (fallback) in the worker's worktree
  - Sends SIGTERM to process groups or individual processes
  - Marks the DB assignment as 'failed' with "killed by user" notes
- Added `active_worker_assignments()` DB function to query coding/integrating assignments
- Added `Workers` subcommand with `Status` and `Kill` actions to the CLI
- Added 6 new tests (676 total passing):
  - db: active_worker_assignments_query
  - db: active_worker_assignments_empty
  - main: test_workers_status_empty
  - main: test_workers_status_with_active
  - main: test_workers_kill_no_active_assignment
  - main: test_workers_kill_marks_as_failed

### Key Files Modified
- `src/main.rs` — Workers subcommand, WorkersAction enum, handle_workers_status, handle_workers_kill
- `src/db.rs` — active_worker_assignments function

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **3su**: Implement periodic reconciliation with full test suite (P2)
- **dgh**: Implement session-to-bead attribution (P2)
- **7ed**: Implement blacksmith integration log and retry commands (P2)
