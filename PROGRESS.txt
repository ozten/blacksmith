## Last Session: Implement structural metrics aggregator (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-a9n (P2): Structural metrics aggregator
- Created `src/structural_metrics.rs` with `analyze()` function that computes all structural metrics in one pass:
  - Fan-in scores (via `fan_in::scores_from_graph`)
  - File sizes (line counts per file)
  - Cohesion/god file detection (via `god_file::detect_god_files`)
  - Cycle participation (via `circular_dep::detect_module_cycles`)
  - API surface width (via `public_api::extract_public_apis`)
  - Boundary violations (via `boundary_violation::detect_boundary_violations`)
- Returns a `StructuralReport` with `ModuleMetrics` (per-module) and `FileMetrics` (per-file)
- Added `mod structural_metrics;` to main.rs
- 11 unit tests all passing, full suite: 1111 passed, 0 failed

### Current State
- Codebase compiles cleanly (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- All 1111 tests pass
- structural_metrics module is ready to be consumed by the historical signal correlator

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-4wc (P2): Implement historical signal correlator (blocked by this bead, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-83g (P3): Add migration map generation for refactor tasks
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
