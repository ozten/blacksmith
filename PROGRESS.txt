## Session: Resolve shared repo-level .blacksmith path in git worktrees (simple-agent-harness-c34r)

### Completed
- Added test coverage in `src/main.rs` proving main checkout and git worktree resolve to the same repository-level `.blacksmith` database path for improvement/progress-style add/list/show behavior.
- New test writes improvements from both main and worktree-resolved data dirs and verifies both entries are visible from both locations.
- Existing non-default config path behavior remains covered by `test_resolve_storage_data_dir_respects_non_default_config_path`.

### Current State
- Only `src/main.rs` was modified.
- Verification passed: targeted test, full `cargo test --release`, `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`, and `cargo fmt --check`.

### Suggested Next Task
- Continue with the next highest-priority ready bead.
