## Last Session: File Resolution Data Model and Cache (2026-02-15)

### What Was Done
- Created src/file_resolution.rs implementing Layer 2 (File Resolution) data model and cache
- FileResolutionMapping struct: concept -> resolved_files + resolved_modules
- FileResolution struct: task_id, base_commit, intent_hash, mappings, derived fields
- DerivedFields struct: affected_modules, blast_radius, boundary_signatures
- DB table `file_resolutions` with UNIQUE(task_id, base_commit, intent_hash) constraint
- Indexes on (task_id, base_commit) and (base_commit) for efficient lookups
- Cache functions: get() (by full key triple), get_latest_for_task(), store(), invalidate_stale(), is_fresh()
- invalidate_stale() deletes entries with non-matching base_commit for lazy regeneration
- Registered module in src/main.rs
- 14 tests covering: store/retrieve, cache miss, different commit/intent misses, upsert, get_latest_for_task, invalidation, freshness checks, empty data, multiple tasks same commit
- Bead simple-agent-harness-0lk closed

### Current State
- All tests pass (except coordinator test which is a pre-existing known slow test)
- Clippy clean (only expected dead_code warnings for not-yet-integrated modules)
- fmt clean

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-ikw (P1): Implement file resolution from intent concepts (now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-ldy (P2): Add integration loop iteration tracking
