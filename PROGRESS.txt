## Last Session: Implement historical signal correlator (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-4wc (P2): Historical signal correlator
- Created `src/signal_correlator.rs` with `correlate()` function that:
  - Queries expansion events per module from DB with recency weighting (recent window gets 2x weight)
  - Queries integration iteration counts per module from DB with recency weighting
  - Queries metadata drift counts per module from file_resolutions table
  - Computes structural smell flags per module (high fan-in, large module, cycle participation, boundary violations, god files, wide API)
  - Identifies modules with BOTH structural smells AND historical failure signals as refactoring candidates
  - Sorts candidates by combined score, computes confidence based on number of independent signal types
- Returns a `CorrelationReport` with `ModuleSignals`, `StructuralSmells`, and `RefactorCandidate` per module
- Added `mod signal_correlator;` to main.rs
- 12 unit tests all passing, full suite: 1123 passed, 0 failed

### Current State
- Codebase compiles cleanly (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- All 1123 tests pass
- signal_correlator module is ready to be consumed by the refactor proposal generator

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-cgo (P2): Add refactor proposal generation (blocked by this bead, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-83g (P3): Add migration map generation for refactor tasks
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
