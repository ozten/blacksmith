## Last Session: Add fan-in hotspot scoring for files (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-q5v: fan-in hotspot scoring
- Created src/fan_in.rs with:
  - `FanInEntry` struct: file, importers count, total_modules, score
  - `compute_fan_in_scores()` — builds import graph and computes fan-in for all files
  - `scores_from_graph()` — computes fan-in from a pre-built import graph (useful for downstream)
  - `hotspots()` — filters entries above a configurable threshold
- Formula: `fan_in_score(file) = count(modules importing file) / total_modules`
- Results sorted descending by score, with path-based tiebreaking for determinism
- 11 tests covering: empty project, single file, one/multiple importers, sorting, hotspot filtering, direct graph input, mod declarations, deterministic ordering

### Current State
- Compilation clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings for not-yet-wired modules)
- Full test suite: 1024 passed, 0 failed (singleton test pre-existing failure), 1 ignored
- fan_in module ready for downstream beads (structural metrics aggregator)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-9xc (P2): Add god file detection via cohesion analysis
- simple-agent-harness-33k (P2): Add circular dependency detection for modules
- simple-agent-harness-aol (P2): Add boundary violation detector for module imports
- simple-agent-harness-n1d (P2): Add metadata regeneration strategy with lazy invalidation
- simple-agent-harness-a9n (P2): Implement structural metrics aggregator (blocked until more metrics done)
