## Session: Resolve shared repo-level .blacksmith path in git worktrees (simple-agent-harness-1d04)

### Completed
- Verified existing implementation satisfies this bead's scope:
  - Default `.blacksmith/config.toml` path resolves to shared repo-level `.blacksmith` from both main checkout and git worktree contexts.
  - Explicit non-default config path behavior remains unchanged.
- Ran required bead verification commands and project quality gates successfully:
  - `cargo test --release test_resolve_storage_data_dir_shared_between_main_and_worktree`
  - `cargo test --release test_resolve_storage_data_dir_respects_non_default_config_path`
  - `cargo test --release`
  - `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`
  - `cargo fmt --check`

### Current State
- No additional code edits were required in this session; repository is clean.
- Bead is ready to close with verification evidence.

### Suggested Next Task
- Proceed to the blocked follow-up bead: `simple-agent-harness-c34r` (blacksmith progress command implementation).
