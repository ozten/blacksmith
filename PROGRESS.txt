## Last Session: Closed simple-agent-harness-cqf (Surface cycle warnings in CLI status output)

### What Was Done
- Updated `build_progress_string()` in `src/runner.rs` to surface cycle warnings in the `blacksmith run` progress line:
  - Progress count now says "schedulable beads" when cycles exist (matching PRD format)
  - Cycle warning now includes "beads" count and fix hint: `⚠ N beads in dependency cycle — run bd dep cycles to fix`
- The `--status` output in `src/status.rs` was already complete from prior sessions (Schedulable line + Cycle warning)

### Current State
- All 869 tests pass, clippy and fmt clean
- Both CLI surfaces now match the PRD spec (SPEC-v3-agents.md lines 775-796)

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Check `bd ready` for next available work
