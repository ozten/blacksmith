## Last Session: Implement brief command with improvement context output (simple-agent-harness-11h)

### Completed
- Created `src/brief.rs` with `handle_brief` function
- `blacksmith brief` generates markdown snippet for prompt injection
- Queries open improvements from DB, formats as: `## OPEN IMPROVEMENTS (N of M)` followed by `Rxx [category] title` lines
- Returns no output if DB file doesn't exist or has no improvements
- Added `db::count_improvements` helper to `src/db.rs`
- Wired `Brief` subcommand in `src/main.rs` (top-level, not under metrics)
- 5 new tests: no DB file, empty DB, shows open, excludes non-open, format matches PRD
- All 183 tests pass, clippy clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings), fmt applied

### Current State
- `blacksmith brief` is fully functional
- Uses same `--output-dir` flag to locate DB as `improve` commands
- Pre-existing dead_code warnings remain for unimplemented features

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Create events and observations tables (cl6) — P1, ready
- Integrate brief injection into session loop pre-session step (2pg) — P1, now unblocked by this bead
- Add quantitative metrics summary to brief command output (pcb) — P2, now unblocked by this bead
