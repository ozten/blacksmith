## Last Session: Enable 3 parallel agents in blacksmith.toml (2026-02-16)

### What Was Done
- Implemented bead simple-agent-harness-5hg (P1): Enable 3 parallel agents
- Added [workers] section to blacksmith.toml: max=3, base_branch="main", worktrees_dir="worktrees"
- Touched STOP file so running blacksmith process exits cleanly for recompile/restart
- All 1123 tests pass, clippy and fmt clean (only pre-existing dead_code warnings)

### Current State
- blacksmith.toml now configured for 3 parallel workers
- STOP file present — operator should: `cargo build --release`, remove STOP, restart blacksmith
- When workers.max > 1, coordinator::run is used instead of serial runner::run
- Worktrees will be created under .blacksmith/worktrees/ for each worker

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-cgo (P2): Add refactor proposal generation from architecture analysis
- simple-agent-harness-83g (P3): Add migration map generation for refactor tasks
- simple-agent-harness-34d (P3): Add architecture agent configuration knobs
