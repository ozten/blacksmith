## Session: Implement GET /api/improvements endpoint (simple-agent-harness-66vi)

### Completed
- Added GET /api/improvements endpoint to serve API
- Modified serve::run to accept &HarnessConfig (was &ServeConfig) to access storage.data_dir for DB path
- Added AppState struct with db_path for axum State extractor
- Added api_improvements handler: opens DB, queries all improvements via db::list_improvements, returns JSON array
- Added serde::Serialize derive to db::Improvement struct for JSON serialization
- Updated main.rs serve command to pass full config instead of config.serve
- All 1080 tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Files Changed
- src/serve.rs: Added AppState, api_improvements handler, changed run() signature
- src/db.rs: Added serde::Serialize derive to Improvement struct
- src/main.rs: Updated serve::run call to pass full config

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- GET /api/improvements returns JSON array with all improvement records

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Other serve API endpoints (simple-agent-harness-3hps, k57l, oadl, zcli, sqpv, zj32, lu1i)
- These sibling beads will benefit from the AppState already set up here
