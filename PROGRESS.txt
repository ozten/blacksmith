## Session: Implement instance discovery and registry (simple-agent-harness-k5z6)

### Completed
- Bead simple-agent-harness-k5z6: Implement instance discovery and registry
- Converted project to Cargo workspace with members = [".", "blacksmith-ui"]
- Created blacksmith-ui crate with dependencies: axum, tower-http, reqwest, socket2, serde, tokio, toml, tracing
- Implemented config.rs: UiConfig with DashboardConfig (port/bind/poll_interval) and [[projects]] array, plus runtime instance persistence to .blacksmith-ui-instances.json
- Implemented discovery.rs: InstanceRegistry with three-layer discovery:
  1. UDP multicast listener on 239.66.83.77:8421 that receives heartbeat packets
  2. Manual [[projects]] entries from blacksmith-ui.toml
  3. Runtime POST /api/instances endpoint that probes /api/health before adding
- Deduplication by normalized URL (lowercase, trailing slash stripped)
- Sweep task marks instances offline after 90s without heartbeat
- Runtime-added instances persisted to JSON file for restart survival
- Routes: GET /api/health, GET /api/instances, POST /api/instances
- All 1080 existing tests pass, zero clippy warnings, fmt clean

### Current State
- Codebase is clean: tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean
- blacksmith-ui is a separate workspace member with its own binary
- Discovery system supports all three sources with merge/dedup

### Suggested Next Tasks
- simple-agent-harness-rxsx: Implement polling and cross-project aggregation (P1, now unblocked)
- simple-agent-harness-fsnv: Implement serve port auto-allocation (P2, ready)
- simple-agent-harness-xi2k: Add estimate API endpoint (P2, ready)
