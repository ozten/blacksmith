## Last Session: Implement session compression with zstd (x1a)

### Completed
- Added `zstd = "0.13"` dependency to Cargo.toml
- Added `compress_after: u32` field to `StorageConfig` (default: 5)
  - Configurable via `[storage] compress_after = N` in blacksmith.toml
- Created `src/compress.rs` with session compression logic:
  - `compress_old_sessions(sessions_dir, current_iteration, compress_after)`: scans sessions dir
    for `.jsonl` files whose iteration number is <= `current - compress_after`, compresses them
    to `.jsonl.zst` using zstd level 3, and removes the originals
  - Handles edge cases: compress_after=0 (disabled), current < threshold, already-compressed
    files, non-numeric filenames, missing directories
  - 10 tests covering all edge cases including round-trip decompression verification
- Wired compression into `runner.rs`: called after JSONL metrics ingestion in the Proceed branch
- Added config tests for `compress_after` field (default value, TOML loading)
- All 569 tests pass, clippy clean (existing dead_code warnings only), fmt clean

### Current State
- Session compression is fully functional in the serial runner (runner.rs)
- Compression is NOT yet wired into the coordinator (multi-worker mode) — that would need
  a separate change if desired
- The retention policy bead (503) depends on this and is now unblocked

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **503**: Implement retention policy enforcement (depends on x1a, now unblocked)
- **e2l**: Implement raw adapter with pass-through extraction (P2)
- **tzx**: Implement prompt_via config with arg/stdin/file delivery modes (P2)
