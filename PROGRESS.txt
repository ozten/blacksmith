## Session: Strengthen LLM customization prompt (simple-agent-harness-6ugm)

### Completed
- Added explicit tool-access warning to LLM_CUSTOMIZATION_PROMPT in src/init.rs:
  - "IMPORTANT: You only have access to Read, Glob, and Grep tools. Do NOT attempt to edit or write any files."
  - "Your entire response must be the complete, updated PROMPT.md content. Do not include explanations, summaries, or commentary."
- Appended "Do NOT output a summary or explanation." to the final output instruction line
- All 1108 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

### Current State
- LLM customization prompt now explicitly forbids file editing and demands full content output
- Belt-and-suspenders with the validation in apply_llm_prompt_result() from previous session

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Pick next ready bead from the queue
