## Session: Resolve shared repo-level .blacksmith path in git worktrees (simple-agent-harness-c34r)

### Completed
- Added command-behavior tests in `src/main.rs` to verify main checkout and git worktree share the same improvements database under default config path resolution.
- Added coverage proving add/list/show semantics from both locations observe the same records when sharing the repo-level `.blacksmith` path.
- Added coverage proving explicit non-default config path keeps worktree-local storage behavior (separate DB from main checkout).
- Updated bead `## Verify` notes with exact commands executed this session.

### Current State
- Changes are limited to `src/main.rs` tests.
- `cargo test --release` passed.
- `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` passed.
- `cargo fmt --check` passed.

### Suggested Next Task
- Continue with the next highest-priority ready bead from `bd ready`.
