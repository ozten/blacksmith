## Last Session: Implement scheduler for assigning beads to idle workers (1ky)

### Completed
- Extended src/scheduler.rs with scheduler types and assignment logic
- Added `ReadyBead` struct: id, priority, affected_globs (Option<Vec<String>>)
- Added `InProgressAssignment` struct: bead_id, affected_globs (Option<Vec<String>>)
- Implemented `next_assignable_tasks(ready_beads, in_progress)`:
  - Returns bead IDs whose affected sets don't overlap with any in-progress task
  - Handles None affected sets (= "affects everything") for both beads and assignments
  - If any in-progress task has no affected set, no new tasks can be assigned
  - If nothing is in progress, all ready beads are assignable
  - Preserves input order (caller sorts by priority)
- Implemented `schedule_next(ready_beads, in_progress)`:
  - Picks the first (highest-priority) non-conflicting bead
  - Returns None if nothing can be assigned
- 15 new scheduler tests covering all edge cases
- All 539 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

### Current State
- scheduler.rs now has full scheduling logic ready for the coordinator
- Reference: SPEC-v3-agents.md lines 462-489

### Suggested Next Tasks
- **3mu**: Wire multi-agent coordinator into blacksmith run (P1, blocked on this)
- **x1a**: Implement session compression with zstd (P2)
- **e2l**: Implement raw adapter with pass-through extraction (P2)
